# Licensing


Veeam Plug-in for Scale Computing HyperCore is licensed by the number of protected Scale Computing HyperCore VMs. Each protected Scale Computing HyperCore VM consumes one Veeam Universal License instance from the license scope. A Scale Computing HyperCore VM is considered protected if it has a restore point created during the past 31 days.

By default, Veeam Plug-in for Scale Computing HyperCore automatically revokes a license instance from a protected VM if no new restore points have been created during the past 31 days. However, you can manually revoke license instances from protected VMs as described in the Veeam Backup & Replication User Guide, section [Revoking License](https://helpcenter.veeam.com/docs/vbr/userguide/revoke_servers.html?ver=13).
