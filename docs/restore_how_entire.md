# Entire VM Restore


To restore a VM, Veeam Plug-in for Scale Computing HyperCore performs the following steps:

1. [This step applies only if you perform restore to the original location and if the source VM is still present in the location] Powers off and removes the source VM.
2. Launches a worker on same host where the processed VM resides.

If no worker is deployed on the host, Veeam Plug-in for Scale Computing HyperCore launches a worker that is deployed on any other Scale Computing HyperCore host connected to the backup infrastructure.

1. Creates a new VM with source VM settings without disks.
2. Restores each VM disk sequentially:

1. Creates a disk on a worker and restores data from a backup to it.
2. Creates a snapshot of the worker VM.
3. Creates a clone of a worker VM snaphot disk on a new VM.
4. Removes the worker VM snapshot.

1. Powers on a restored VM, if automatic power on is enabled.
2. Suspends the worker when the restore session completes.
