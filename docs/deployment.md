# Deployment


To access the Veeam Plug-in for Scale Computing HyperCore functionality, you can either deploy a new backup server as described in the [Veeam Backup & Replication User Guide](https://helpcenter.veeam.com/docs/vbr/userguide/deployment.html?ver=13) or use a backup server that already exists in your backup infrastructure if it meets the [Veeam Plug-in for Scale Computing HyperCore system requirements](system_requirements.md).

If you upgrade Veeam Backup & Replication that is installed on a Linux machine, Veeam Plug-in for Scale Computing HyperCore will not be automatically installed along the new Veeam Backup & Replication version. For details on how to install it manually, see [Veeam Backup & Replication User Guide](https://helpcenter.veeam.com/docs/vbr/userguide/update_appliance_install_updates.html?ver=13).
