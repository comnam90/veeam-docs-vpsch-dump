# Connecting Scale Computing HyperCore Cluster


A Scale Computing HyperCore cluster allows the backup server to access Scale Computing HyperCore resources such as VMs, storage and networks. After you add a Scale Computing HyperCore cluster to the backup infrastructure, you will be able to deploy workers and to manage data protection tasks for Scale Computing HyperCore VMs.
