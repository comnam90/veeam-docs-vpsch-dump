# Backup Retention


Veeam Plug-in for Scale Computing HyperCore retains the latest restore points defined in job scheduling settings as described in the [Step 4. Specify Backup Job Settings](backup_job_create_destination.md) section. For backup chains created by jobs without scheduled active or synthetic full backups, Veeam Plug-in for Scale Computing HyperCore applies [forever forward incremental backup retention policy](#ffi). For backup chains created by jobs that regularly produce active or synthetic full backups, Veeam Plug-in for Scale Computing HyperCore applies [forward incremental backup retention policy](#fi).

| Note |
| For backup chains created by jobs that no longer exist, Veeam Plug-in for Scale Computing HyperCore applies a separate retention mechanism as described in the Veeam Backup & Replication User Guide, section [Background Retention](https://helpcenter.veeam.com/docs/vbr/userguide/background_retention_job.html?ver=13). |

Forever Forward Incremental Backup Retention Policy

To track and remove redundant restore points from a forever forward incremental backup chain, Veeam Plug-in for Scale Computing HyperCore performs the following actions once a day:

1. Veeam Plug-in for Scale Computing HyperCore checks the configuration database to detect backup chains with restore points that are older than the specified time limit.
2. If a redundant restore point exists in a backup chain, Veeam Plug-in for Scale Computing HyperCore transforms the backup chain in the following way:

1. Rebuilds the full backup to include there data of the incremental backup that follows the full backup. To do that, Veeam Plug-in for Scale Computing HyperCore injects into the full backup data blocks from the earliest incremental backup in the chain. This way, the full backup ‘moves’ forward in the standard backup chain.

1. Removes the earliest incremental backup from the chain as redundant — this data has already been injected into the full backup.

1. Veeam Plug-in for Scale Computing HyperCore repeats step 2 for all other redundant restore points found in the backup chain until all the restore points are removed. As data from multiple restore points is injected into the rebuilt full backup, Veeam Plug-in for Scale Computing HyperCore ensures that the backup chain is not broken and that you will be able to recover your data when needed.

Forward Incremental Backup Retention Policy

To track and remove redundant restore points from a forward incremental backup chain, Veeam Plug-in for Scale Computing HyperCore performs the following actions once a day:

1. Veeam Plug-in for Scale Computing HyperCore checks the configuration database to detect forward incremental backup chains where a new full backup has been created (which starts a new backup chain fragment).
2. Veeam Plug-in for Scale Computing HyperCore checks whether the period to keep restore points in the new chain fragment has reached the allowed time limit.

1. If the new backup chain fragment has reached the limit of allowed restore points, Veeam Plug-in for Scale Computing HyperCore removes all restore points of the older backup chain fragment.
